## Descriptions

The stock market is unpredictable and there are many differing opinions about which stocks will do well in the future. Meanwhile, visualizations of market opinions are very rare. But, traders need a quick way to access the opinions of their peers without having to search through websites like Stocktwits for it. Also, market newcomers who want to buy stock but are not sure which companies are popular or trending need the wisdom of current traders as well. Our solution is to build a dashboard to get an insight into stock market through Stocktwits in a simple way.
